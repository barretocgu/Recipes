    <h1>Roadside Diner Cheeseburger Quiche</h1>
    <img src="../images/quiche.jpg">
    <h2>Want brunch for dinner and need to serve a lot of people? Look no further!</h2>
    <p>My savory main-dish quiche tastes just like its burger counterpart. Easy and appealing, this cheeseburger quiche is pretty enough to serve guests. <em>—Barbara J. Miller, Oakdale, Minnesota</em> </p>
    <h3>Ingredients needed:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sheet refrigerated pie crust</li>
        <li>3/4 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>2 plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dill pickle relish</li>
        <li>1/2 cup crumbled cooked bacon</li>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup 2% milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons prepared mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1-1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Optional: Mayonnaise, additional pickle relish, crumbled cooked bacon, chopped onion and chopped tomato</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Unroll crust into a 9-in. deep-dish pie plate; flute edges and set aside. In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink, breaking it into crumbles; drain. Stir in the tomatoes, onion, relish and bacon. Transfer to prepared crust.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, cream, milk, mustard, pepper sauce, salt and pepper. Pour over beef mixture. Sprinkle with cheeses.</li>
        <li>Bake until a knife inserted in center comes out clean, 50-60 minutes. If necessary, cover edges with foil during the last 15 minutes to prevent overbrowning. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting. Garnish with optional ingredients as desired.</li>
    </ol>
